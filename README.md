# Crypt

![alt text](https://github.com/donnums/python-encrypt-decrypt/raw/master/crypt.jpg "Program")

Crypt is a simple encryptor/decryptor program that runs in your terminal

The program lets you encrypt messages using a selection of different algorithms using different keys, and then decrypt these messages back to plaintext.

This should not be used to encrypt sensitive information, as these algorithms are easy to crack. This is just something I made because I wanted to learn how these algorithms work.

(ie. The cbc algorithms uses an initialization vector in addition to the key, but this iv is always set to be the same)
